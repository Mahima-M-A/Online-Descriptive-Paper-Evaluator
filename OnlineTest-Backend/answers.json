    "4":"Context-sensitive spelling correction is the task of fixing spelling errors that result in valid words. To detect Real-word error is the class of errors that results in an actual word of English. This can happen from typographical errors (insertion, deletion, transposition) that accidently produce a real word (eg there for three), or because the writer substituted the wrong spelling of a homophone or near-homophone (eg dessert for desert, or piece for peace). The task of correcting these errors is called context-sensitive spelling error correction. Local errors are those that are probably detectable from the immediate surrounding words, while global errors are ones in which error detection requires examination of a larger context."
